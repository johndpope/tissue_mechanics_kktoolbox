function s=eval_direct(cent,coeff,u)
%
% Function which directly evaluates the radial basis
% function spline
%
% s(u) = linear polynomial +
% \sum_i=1^n coeff(i) * phi(u - cent(i,:))
%
% at the point u where the linear polynomial is given in
% terms of its monomial coefficients.
%
% Syntax s=eval_direct(cent,coeff,u)
%
% Inputs
% cent n by dim array The coordinates of the centres
% coeff n+dim+1 vector Coefficients with the linear
% polynomial part last.
% u row vector Point at which to evaluate
%
% Output
% s Value of the RBF at position u
%
% Code is written for clarity rather than Matlab
% efficiency.
[n dim] = size(cent);
s=0;
for j=1:n
s = s + coeff(j)*phi( norm(u - cent(j,:)) );
end
% Now the linear polynomial bit
s=s+coeff(n+1); % The constant
for i=1:dim
s=s+coeff(i+n+1)*u(i); % The various components of u
